# Faust Algebra
 FaustAlgebra + tlib : a Faust Algebra is essentially an abstract class representing all Faust primitives. An example of a concrete algebra, TestAlgebra, is given. It returns the depth of an expression. 
 
 Because of various dependencies related to Faust symbols, the tree library tlib is also included. 

 To use FaustAlgebra in your project you will have to copy the tlib and FaustAlgebra folders in your project.
